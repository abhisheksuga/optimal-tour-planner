# Optimal Tour Planner

This repository contains a Python-based solution for planning an optimal tour from point A to point B and back to point A, minimizing the travel cost. The project employs a heuristic approach for initial pathfinding and an approximation algorithm for comparison and evaluation. This can be particularly useful for solving problems similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with practical and efficient methods.

## Features
- **Heuristic Approach**: Implements a heuristic algorithm to find a cost-effective tour route.
- **Approximation Algorithm**: Uses an approximation algorithm to compare and verify the efficiency of the heuristic solution.
- **Cost Minimization**: Focuses on minimizing the total travel cost, ensuring an optimized travel plan.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abhisheksuga/optimal-tour-planner.git
2 . Navigate to the project directory:
   cd optimal-tour-planner
3. Run the main script to see the heuristic and approximation algorithms in action:
   python main.py
